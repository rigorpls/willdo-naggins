#+title: Beta-testing

* Preparation
- Call ~M-: (willdo-naggins--prepare)~
  - This creates =$XDG_DATA_HOME/willdo-naggins= and creates/opens =db.sqlite=
    inside
* What to test and look out for
- Call ~willdo-naggins-learn~ to create a nag for the current headline
- Call ~willdo-naggins-query-single~ to interact with current nags
  - Once you have nags, a childframe should show up. Configure its background
    color with ~willdo-naggins-win-background-color~.
  - Edit stuff, snooze, call the query function again, etc.
  - Default nag snooze is 1 hour. Configurable with
    ~willdo-naggins-snooze-duration-hours~.
  - Currently, there's no way to "unsnooze" a nag. Wait for the expiration and
    it will show up again.
  - Currently, there's no way to "unforget" a nag. It is still in the db, but WN
    won't list it. You need to edit the db manually.
- Call ~willdo-naggins-suggest-single~ to scan and interact with "suggestions"
  - Suggestions are, for now, headlines with SCHEDULED or DEADLINE from ~(org-agenda-files)~
  - These are candidate nags that you can either have WN "learn" or "ignore"
    - Ignoring adds a tag to the headline. Configurable with ~willdo-naggins--suggest-ignore-tag~.
* Information on internals
- The preparation step should be harmless
  - Just mentioning in case you call it multiple times
- "Learning" is (mostly) harmless
  - WN's DB is basically a list of org-ids (which WN creates)
  - WN assigns an org-id to the headline if it doesn't have one
    - This is the only editing during acquisition
- There is a _very_ simple undo action for edits inside the query function
  - It only calls ~undo-only~, nothing WN-specific
  - Mostly to avoid mistaken key presses, don't rely on it for larger things or
    for out-of-order operations (e.g., after calling next/prev and editing
    something else)
- WN adds two timers:
  - one for maintaining the snooze function (every 5 mins, configurable)
  - another for the tooltip (every 5 mins, schedule a tooltip if you're idle for 30s)
- In the WN db, nags are just a list of org-ids
  - Each org-id has a "snooze until" timestamp and a "forget" flag
  - WN clears the snooze-until field if the maintenance function runs after that timestamp
